# Theme Step 3
A one file theme as a starting point for anyone who wants to start building themes for WordPress.

Splitting up the theme into multiple files.

The goal was to make the start a little simpler than the [\_s theme](http://underscores.me/)

On step three we take the theme to the next stage and introduce:

	- a single view for posts
	- sidebar with a widget area
	- functions file for registering a widget area
